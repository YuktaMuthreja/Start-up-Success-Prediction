# Start-Up Success Prediction

# Project Description:

## Data Exploration and Attribute Analysis:

- Displayed statistical values and visualizations (e.g., histograms) for each attribute.
- Identified attributes that required special treatment and specified the necessary treatments. 

## Relationship Analysis:

- Analyzed relationships between data attributes and between attributes and labels.
- Computed Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and generated scatter plots. 

## Data Splitting and Validation:

Selected 20% for testing, 20% for validation, and used the remaining 60% for training.
Described the process and ensured representativeness of test and validation portions. 

## Classifier Training and Hyperparameter Tuning:

- Implemented Multinomial Logistic Regression Explored hyperparameters: C, solver, max number of iterations. (10 points)
- Implemented Support Vector Machines: Explored hyperparameters: C, kernel, degree of polynomial kernel, gamma. (10 points)
- Implemented Random Forest classifier: Explored hyperparameters: number of trees, max depth, minimum samples for split and leaf. (10 points)

## Ensemble Classifier:

- Combined classifiers into an ensemble for improved performance.
- Received an accuracy score of 80%  on the validation set.
- Tested the best-performing ensemble on the test set and discussed findings.
